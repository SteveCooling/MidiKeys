/**
 *  KeyboardMux
 *  - Keyboard scanner for Arduino Leonardo (ATMEGA32U4)
 *
 *  Scan 16 banks (High nybble of PORTF) and read PORTB for each bank.
 * 
 *  For velocity sensitive keyboards, PORTF bit 4 selects the second switch for each key.
 *  Put another way: Bank 1 will be the secondary switches of bank 0.
 * 
 *  Output of LSB on PORTF is sent to the MUX and is subsequently read on PORTB.
 *  If you are running pullups on PORTB, set it low - if you need to read high bits, set it high.
