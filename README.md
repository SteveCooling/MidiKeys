# MidiKeys

Dissecting an old broken organ I got the idea to turn it into a MIDI keyboard.
This is the code that reads the keys and knobs, and turns it into MIDI messages.

Works:

* Basic keyboard multiplexing (organ style)

I'd like:

* Velocity sensitivity (dual switches per key)
* Pot/slider multiplexing
* Mackie style DAW control

Maybe even:

* Channel pressure
* Pressure sensors on each key for full polyphonic aftertouch
